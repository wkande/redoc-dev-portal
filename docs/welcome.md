# Welcome

Our interactive portal is designed to help you understand how to consume the CloudUla Datacenter 
APIs. For those of you who landed here via a web search and do not know us, CloudUla is a managed services Datacenter. We will host your equipment and keep it running per your specifications 24x7.


## Fictitious
Of course all of this is just for fun: because CloudUla is a **fictitious** company and this portal is just an example of how to use the <a href="https://www.redoc.ly/developer-portal">Redocly Developer Portal</a> and API documentation tools, all part of their <b>docs-as-code</b>  strategy.  

## Pricing
The CloudUla APIs are a free resource for all CloudUla Datacenter customers. There is no rate limiting but there is a <a href="javascript:alert('If we had a Terms of Use Agreement it would be fictitious so we can skip it.');">Terms of Use Agreement</a>.
  

## Asking for help

Don't forget about that **fictitious** company thing.
